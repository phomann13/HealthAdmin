        <strong><u>Message from the Author:</u></strong>
        <br>
            As a student, I have recognized a need for accessible and realiable health information, particularly for individuals with low health literacy. 
        Through diligent research, I have created this platform with the aim of making healthcare information and appropriate medical decision making more approachable and understandable for all.
