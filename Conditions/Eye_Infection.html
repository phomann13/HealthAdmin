    <h2>What is an Eye Infection?</h2>
    <p2>An eye infection, also known as ocular infection or conjunctivitis, refers to an inflammation or infection of the eye tissues. It can affect various parts of the eye, such as the conjunctiva (the clear tissue covering the white part of the eye) or the eyelids. Eye infections can be caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi, or allergens. Common causes include exposure to contaminated water, poor hygiene, close contact with infected individuals, and allergies. Bacterial and viral infections are highly contagious and can easily spread through direct or indirect contact.</p2>
    <h2>What are the Symtpoms of an Eye Infection?</h2>
    <p2>The symptoms of an eye infection can vary depending on the cause, but commonly include redness, itching, irritation, discharge, excessive tearing, swollen eyelids, sensitivity to light, and blurred vision. Patients may also experience a gritty or foreign body sensation in the eye. In severe cases, eye infections can cause pain and significantly impair vision. </p2>
    <h2>Where should You receive treatment?</h2>
    <p2>The appropriate healthcare setting for eye infections depends on the severity of symptoms. Mild cases of conjunctivitis caused by allergies or minor irritants can often be managed with over-the-counter eye drops or home remedies. In such cases, visiting a primary care doctor or an optometrist is usually sufficient. However, if the symptoms are severe, accompanied by intense pain, rapid deterioration of vision, or if there is a suspicion of a more serious underlying condition, it is advisable to go to an urgent care clinic or an emergency room. These healthcare settings have the necessary resources and expertise to handle more severe eye infections and provide immediate treatment and evaluation by a specialist if needed.</p2>
