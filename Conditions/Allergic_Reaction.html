    <h2>What is an Allergic Reaction?</h2>
    <p2>An allergic reaction occurs when the immune system overreacts to a substance that is usually harmless, known as an allergen. Common allergens include pollen, certain foods (e.g., peanuts, shellfish), medications (e.g., penicillin), insect stings, and latex. When a person with allergies comes into contact with an allergen, their immune system releases chemicals, such as histamine, which trigger the symptoms of an allergic reaction.</p2>
    <h2>What are the Symtpoms of an Allergic Reaction?</h2>
    <p2>The symptoms of an allergic reaction can vary depending on the severity and the individual's sensitivity to the allergen. Mild to moderate symptoms may include sneezing, itching, hives, runny nose, watery eyes, and mild swelling. In more severe cases, an allergic reaction can lead to difficulty breathing, wheezing, throat tightness, rapid heartbeat, dizziness, and even anaphylaxis, a life-threatening reaction that requires immediate medical attention.</p2>
    <h2>Where should You receive treatment?</h2>
    <p2>The appropriate course of action for someone experiencing an allergic reaction depends on the severity of their symptoms. If the symptoms are mild and limited to itching, sneezing, or minor skin reactions, patients can usually visit their primary care doctor. Primary care physicians can provide guidance, prescribe antihistamines or other medications, and help manage the symptoms. Urgent care facilities can be a good option for individuals with moderate symptoms, such as moderate difficulty breathing or persistent hives. However, if the symptoms are severe, such as significant difficulty breathing, swelling of the face or throat, or signs of anaphylaxis, it is crucial to seek immediate emergency medical care by going to the emergency room or calling emergency services. Prompt medical attention is necessary to ensure the patient receives appropriate treatment, including epinephrine (adrenaline) injections and close monitoring.</p2>
