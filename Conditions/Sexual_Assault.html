    <h2>What is Sexual Assault?</h2>
    <p2>Sexual assault refers to any form of non-consensual sexual activity that occurs without the explicit consent of one or more individuals involved. It involves the use of force, threats, manipulation, or coercion to engage in sexual acts against a person's will. Sexual assault can take various forms, including rape, molestation, groping, sexual harassment, or any unwanted sexual contact.</p2>
    <h2>What are the Symtpoms of Sexual Assault?</h2>
    <p2>The symptoms of sexual assault can vary from person to person, but there are some common signs that survivors may experience. These symptoms can be both physical and emotional. Physical symptoms may include injuries like bruises, cuts, or pain in the genital area, as well as sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Emotional symptoms can include feelings of fear, shame, guilt, or confusion. Survivors may also experience anxiety, depression, trouble sleeping, nightmares, or flashbacks related to the assault. They may have changes in appetite, difficulty concentrating, or withdraw from social activities. It's important to remember that each survivor's experience is unique, and their symptoms may differ.</p2>
    <h2>Where should You receive treatment?</h2>
    <p2>Victims of sexual assault should seek medical treatment and support as soon as possible. Depending on the severity of their situation, they have several options for where to receive care. In cases of immediate physical danger, severe injuries, or excessive bleeding, it is crucial to go directly to the emergency room for urgent medical attention. The emergency room is equipped to provide comprehensive medical care, including addressing physical injuries, collecting forensic evidence, and initiating necessary treatments. For less severe cases or when there is no immediate physical danger, victims can consider visiting a primary care doctor or an urgent care clinic. These healthcare settings can offer initial medical assessment, documentation of injuries, testing for sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and referrals to specialized services such as sexual assault nurse examiners, therapists, or support groups. It is important for victims to receive appropriate medical care, emotional support, and follow-up care to address both physical and psychological needs.</p2>
