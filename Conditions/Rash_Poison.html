    <h2>What is Rash?</h2>
    <p2>A rash refers to a change in the skin's appearance, characterized by redness, discoloration, bumps, blisters, or other irregularities. It can occur due to various factors, including allergies, infections, autoimmune disorders, medications, or environmental irritants. Rashes can be localized to a specific area or spread across larger parts of the body. One common example is poison ivy rash caused by contact with poison ivy plants, resulting in itchy, red, and blistering skin.</p2>
    <h2>What are the Symtpoms of a Rash?</h2>
    <p2>The symptoms of a rash can vary depending on the underlying cause. Common symptoms include redness, itching, swelling, pain, and the presence of bumps, blisters, or scales on the skin. Some rashes may also cause additional symptoms such as fever, headache, fatigue, or joint pain. In severe cases, rashes can be accompanied by difficulty breathing, facial swelling, or signs of anaphylaxis, indicating a potentially life-threatening condition.</p2>
    <h2>Where should You receive treatment?</h2>
    <p2>The severity of the symptoms helps determine where patients should seek medical care. In general, for mild rashes that are not spreading rapidly and are not associated with severe symptoms, a primary care doctor can be the initial point of contact. Primary care doctors can evaluate the rash, determine its cause, and prescribe appropriate treatments or medications. However, if the rash is severe, covers a large area of the body, or is accompanied by severe symptoms like difficulty breathing or signs of anaphylaxis, immediate medical attention is necessary. In such cases, urgent care or an emergency room should be sought, as they have the resources and expertise to handle more serious and potentially life-threatening conditions.</p2>
