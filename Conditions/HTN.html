    <h2>What is High Blood Pressure?</h2>
    <p2>High blood pressure, also known as hypertension, is a medical condition characterized by elevated blood pressure levels in the arteries. Blood pressure is measured using two numbers: systolic pressure and diastolic pressure. The systolic pressure represents the force when the heart contracts, while the diastolic pressure signifies the force when the heart is at rest between beats. Normal blood pressure is typically around 120/80 mmHg, but individuals with high blood pressure have readings consistently exceeding this range.</p2>
    <h2>What are the Symtpoms of High Blood Pressure?</h2>
    <p2>Several factors contribute to the development of high blood pressure. These include genetics, lifestyle choices, and underlying health conditions. Unhealthy eating habits, such as consuming excessive sodium and low potassium, along with sedentary behavior, obesity, and excessive alcohol consumption, can increase the risk. Other risk factors include age, family history of hypertension, and certain medical conditions like diabetes, kidney disease, and sleep apnea.</p2>
    <h2>Where should You receive treatment?</h2>
    <p2>Symptoms of high blood pressure are often silent, earning it the nickname "the silent killer." Many individuals with high blood pressure experience no noticeable signs or symptoms. However, in severe cases or when blood pressure spikes suddenly, symptoms may include severe headaches, shortness of breath, chest pain, dizziness, visual changes, and confusion. If a person experiences any of these severe symptoms, they should seek immediate medical attention at an emergency room. On the other hand, individuals with moderate symptoms, such as persistent mild headaches or mild shortness of breath, should consult a primary care doctor. If primary care is not available or if the symptoms worsen rapidly, urgent care may be a suitable alternative. It is important to regularly monitor blood pressure levels and seek medical advice if consistently elevated readings are obtained. A primary care doctor can provide ongoing management and help prevent complications associated with high blood pressure.</p2>
