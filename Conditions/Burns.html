    <h2>What is a Burn?</h2>
    <p2>A burn is an injury to the skin or underlying tissues caused by heat, chemicals, electricity, or radiation. The severity of a burn can vary, and they are typically classified into different degrees. First-degree burns affect the outer layer of the skin, resulting in redness, pain, and mild swelling. Second-degree burns extend into the second layer of the skin, forming blisters, intense pain, and potential swelling. Third-degree burns are the most severe, as they extend through all skin layers and can affect muscles, tendons, and bones. Third-degree burns may appear white or charred, and the affected area may be numb due to nerve damage.</p2>
    <h2>Where should You receive treatment?</h2>
    <p2>
        The severity of the symptoms helps determine the level of medical care needed for burn treatment. 
        <br>
        <br>
        For minor first-degree burns with small affected areas, it is generally sufficient to manage the burn at home with basic first aid measures, such as cooling the area with cool (not cold) water, applying a clean, non-stick dressing, and taking over-the-counter pain relievers if necessary. However, if the burn is larger, covers sensitive areas (such as the face or genitals), or shows signs of infection, it is advisable to seek medical attention from a primary care doctor.
        <br>
        <br>
        For second-degree burns that cover a larger area or involve critical body parts, such as the face, hands, feet, or genitals, it is generally recommended to visit an urgent care center or an emergency room. Medical professionals in these settings can provide appropriate wound care, prescribe pain medication, administer tetanus shots if needed, and assess the need for further treatment. Third-degree burns always require immediate medical attention and should be treated as a medical emergency. In such cases, patients should go directly to the emergency room where they can receive specialized burn care from a multidisciplinary team of healthcare providers, including burn surgeons and nurses.
        <br>
        <br>
        In summary, burns are injuries to the skin and underlying tissues caused by various factors. The severity of symptoms determines the appropriate level of medical care needed. Minor first-degree burns can often be managed at home, while more severe burns may require attention from a primary care doctor, urgent care center, or emergency room. Second-degree burns and severe cases are best treated at an urgent care center or emergency room, while third-degree burns always demand immediate emergency room attention.
